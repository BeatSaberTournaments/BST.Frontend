  The API used for BST


  Endpoints that requires a DEV API-Key or Tournament API-Key*:

  - Tournaments/[id]/BST - Tournaments Full*

  - Tournaments/BST - Tournament List

  - Users/BST - User List


  *(Tournament API Keys are unique to the tournaments, and can only be generated by the tournament admins assigned to the tournament)


  API Keys:

  - Developer/`BSTD(eveloper)` Key:
  	- BSTD-XXXXX-E970-XXXXXXXXXXXX 
  		 - Developer keys always starts with `BSTD`, followed by a 5 letter idenfitier to identify the person who owns it, followed by `E970` because I said so, followed by a randomized 12-character string.

  - Tournament/`BSTT(ournament)` Key:
  	- BSTT-XXXXX-E970-XXXXXXXXXXXX
  		- Tournament keys always starts with `BSTD`, followed by a 5 letter idenfitier to identify the tournament it belongs to, followed by `E970` because I said so, followed by a randomized 12-character string.

  		
  To pass an API key, add a **Request header** called `apikey` and pass your API key in this.

  A normal query parameter will not work.
